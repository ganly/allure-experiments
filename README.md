Inspiration
-----------

Frank Escobar's 
[Allure Docker Service Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/frankescobar/allure-docker-service)
was great inspiration.

It showed how the system worked, but that wasn't quite how I wanted to use it.


My use case
-----------

I'd like a docker image that has a bunch of commands I can use from shell
scripts, makefiles and ideally with the
[entr](https://bitbucket.org/eradman/entr/src/default/)
command.
